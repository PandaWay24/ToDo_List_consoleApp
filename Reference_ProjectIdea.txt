Project Idea: To-Do List Application

Create a simple command-line to-do list application in Python.
This project demonstrates data manipulation, user input, and basic file handling.

Here are the core features to be implemented in this project:

> Task Management: Users should be able to add, view, update, and delete tasks.
> Task Priority: Allow users to set priorities for tasks (e.g., high, medium, low) and sort tasks based on priority.
> Due Dates: Enable users to set due dates for tasks and sort tasks based on their due dates.
> Categories/Tags: Implement the ability to assign categories or tags to tasks and filter tasks based on categories.
> Persistence: Save tasks to a file so that they can be loaded and modified on subsequent runs of the program.
> User-Friendly Interface: Create a user-friendly and intuitive command-line interface with options and menus.
> Data Validation: Validate user inputs and handle errors gracefully.

This project will demonstrate your skills in working with data structures (lists or dictionaries),
file I/O, and basic user interaction.
